# grok-search

[简体中文](README.md) | **English**

`grok-search` is a general-purpose AI agent skill / script bundle that provides three web access capabilities through small Node.js scripts:

- **Search**: use the Responses API with Grok / OpenRouter / Responses-compatible endpoints, plus independent Tavily / Firecrawl sources in parallel.
- **Fetch**: fetch readable content from a concrete URL, preferring Tavily / Firecrawl and falling back to keyless Direct Fetch.
- **Map**: discover candidate URLs on a website, preferring Tavily Map and falling back to lightweight Direct Map.

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=18.17`
- Run `npm install` once to install the `undici` transport dependency
- `GROK_API_URL` and `GROK_API_KEY` for `search.js`

## Quick Start

Install dependencies once, then run scripts from the project root:

```bash
npm install
./scripts/search.js "latest Node.js LTS"
./scripts/fetch.js https://example.com
./scripts/map.js https://docs.example.com --limit 20
```

## Use With pi (Example)

Clone or copy this directory into your pi skills location, then enable the skill through `SKILL.md`.

The commands are still direct script invocations:

```bash
./scripts/search.js "latest Node.js LTS"
./scripts/fetch.js https://example.com
./scripts/map.js https://docs.example.com --limit 20
```

Other agent harnesses can use the same pattern: read `SKILL.md`, then run `scripts/search.js`, `scripts/fetch.js`, or `scripts/map.js` when needed.

## Configuration

Recommended: keep long-lived keys in:

```text
~/.config/grok-search/config.json
```

Copy the example config first:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/grok-search
cp config.example.json ~/.config/grok-search/config.json
chmod 600 ~/.config/grok-search/config.json
```

Full configuration example:

```json
{
  "apiUrl": "https://api.x.ai/v1",
  "apiKey": "your-grok-api-key",
  "apiProvider": "xai",
  "model": "grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309",
  "responsesMaxTurns": 3,
  "responsesReasoningEffort": "low",
  "responsesAllowedDomains": [],
  "responsesExcludedDomains": [],
  "responsesAllowedXHandles": [],
  "responsesExcludedXHandles": [],
  "responsesOpenRouterEngine": "auto",
  "defaultExtra": 6,
  "sourceChars": 400,
  "tavilyApiKey": "",
  "tavilyApiKeys": [],
  "tavilyApiUrl": "https://api.tavily.com",
  "tavilyProxyUrl": "",
  "tavilyProxyKey": "",
  "tavilyProxyTimeoutMs": 12000,
  "firecrawlApiKey": "",
  "firecrawlApiUrl": "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2",
  "outputDir": "",
  "stateDir": "",
  "runLog": true
}
```

Common configuration rules:

- `apiUrl` is the API base URL that supports `/responses`. The script requests `{apiUrl}/responses`, so do not include `/responses` itself.
- `apiProvider` accepts exactly one value:
  - `xai`: the official xAI endpoint, using `web_search` and `x_search` according to `searchSource`.
  - `openrouter`: the OpenRouter endpoint, using `openrouter:web_search`; `responsesOpenRouterEngine` selects its search engine.
  - `openai-compatible`: a relay, proxy, or compatible service that supports xAI-style Responses and the `web_search` tool. A Chat-Completions-only endpoint is not sufficient.
- When `apiProvider` is omitted, it is inferred from the URL: URLs containing `openrouter` use `openrouter`, URLs containing `api.x.ai` use `xai`, and all others use `openai-compatible`. Set it explicitly for relay services to avoid selecting the wrong request format.
- `model` must be an ID supported by that endpoint. `responsesMaxTurns` is an integer of at least 1. Common `responsesReasoningEffort` values are `low`, `medium`, and `high`, but support depends on the selected model and provider.
- `responsesAllowedDomains`, `responsesExcludedDomains`, `responsesAllowedXHandles`, and `responsesExcludedXHandles` are arrays and may contain multiple values, for example `["github.com", "docs.python.org"]`. The allowed and excluded forms of the same filter are mutually exclusive. Domains are capped at 5, X handles at 20. In environment variables, separate multiple values with commas.
- `searchSource` accepts `web`, `x`, or `both` and selects which search tools are attached by default; the `--source` flag takes precedence. X date windows vary per query and are only available as `--x-from-date` / `--x-to-date`, with no config counterpart.
- The old `responsesIncludeXSearch` / `GROK_RESPONSES_INCLUDE_X_SEARCH` option has been removed (deprecated 2026-08, removed 2026-09). A `true` value now fails with `CONFIG_OPTION_REMOVED` instead of silently dropping X search; switch to `searchSource: "both"`. `false` or absent is unaffected.
- Precedence is CLI > environment > config file > built-in default. Note that you write the config file while the agent invoking this tool writes the CLI args: scalar settings such as `searchSource` are **defaults** the agent may override, and the value actually used is always recorded in `diagnostics.options`. Configured **restrictions**, however, are never silently discarded — allow-lists and deny-lists are both restrictions, and CLI values may only narrow them. Stepping outside one raises `RESPONSES_FILTER_FORBIDDEN`, emptying an allow-list raises `RESPONSES_FILTER_EMPTY`, and two deny-lists are merged rather than replaced. See [docs/responses-mode.md](docs/responses-mode.md#配置与命令行的优先级).
- `responsesOpenRouterEngine` accepts `auto`, `native`, `exa`, `firecrawl`, `parallel`, or `perplexity`, and only applies when `apiProvider` is `openrouter`.
- `tavilyApiKey` is optional. Put several official keys in `tavilyApiKeys` (or comma-separated `TAVILY_API_KEYS`); the pool rotates only on quota or auth failure, and the cursor lives at `~/.cache/grok-search/tavily-rr.json`. `tavilyProxyUrl` plus `tavilyProxyKey` is a separate third-party compatible endpoint: the proxy is tried first (12s, no retry) and HTTP failures or empty search/map results fall back to official keys. Do not put the proxy URL in `tavilyApiUrl`; the two key types are not interchangeable. `firecrawlApiKey` may also be empty to use Firecrawl Keyless. An empty `outputDir` uses `~/.cache/grok-search/outputs/`; an empty `stateDir` uses `~/.cache/grok-search/` for the Firecrawl cooldown state. `runLog: false` disables the per-run record files.

For OpenRouter, replace the core fields with:

```json
{
  "apiUrl": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  "apiKey": "your-openrouter-api-key",
  "apiProvider": "openrouter",
  "model": "your-openrouter-model-id",
  "responsesOpenRouterEngine": "auto"
}
```

For a Responses-compatible relay, replace the core fields with:

```json
{
  "apiUrl": "https://your-endpoint.example/v1",
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "apiProvider": "openai-compatible",
  "model": "the-model-id-supported-by-your-endpoint"
}
```

Then edit the copied file with your real keys. Environment variables still take priority over the config file, which is useful for one-off overrides and CI.

This project does **not** auto-load `.env` files. If you prefer env vars, export them in your shell yourself.

### Proxy

Node's native `fetch` does not reliably honor terminal proxy variables by default. These scripts install an `undici` `EnvHttpProxyAgent` automatically when proxy environment variables are present, so outbound requests use your terminal proxy setup.

Supported variables:

- `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`
- `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`
- `ALL_PROXY` / `all_proxy`
- `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`
- `GROK_PROXY` to explicitly set one proxy URL for this tool, or `GROK_PROXY=off` to force direct connections. An invalid explicit `GROK_PROXY` fails the command (`PROXY_CONFIG_INVALID`) instead of silently falling back to a direct connection; failures of ambient proxy variables stay non-fatal and surface via `diagnostics.options.proxy_mode` on search

`NO_PROXY` is honored, and loopback hosts (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) are always added to the bypass list.

| Environment variable | Config key | Required | Used by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GROK_API_URL` | `apiUrl` | Yes for search | `search.js` | Base URL that supports `/responses`. |
| `GROK_API_KEY` | `apiKey` | Yes for search | `search.js` | API key for `GROK_API_URL`. |
| `GROK_API_PROVIDER` | `apiProvider` | No | `search.js` | Selects the Responses tool request format, not an additional search source. Accepts `xai`, `openrouter`, or `openai-compatible`; inferred from the URL when omitted. |
| `GROK_MODEL` | `model` | No | `search.js` | Defaults to `grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309`. On CPA-compatible upstreams this model runs server-side `web_search`; plain Chat Completions models and the free CLI account pool do not. |
| `GROK_RESPONSES_MAX_TURNS` | `responsesMaxTurns` | No | Responses | Responses agentic turn limit; a hard cap for X search only, web search is not bound by it. Default: `3`. |
| `GROK_RESPONSES_REASONING_EFFORT` | `responsesReasoningEffort` | No | Responses | Default: `low`. |
| `GROK_RESPONSES_PARALLEL_TOOL_CALLS` | `responsesParallelToolCalls` | No | Responses | `true` / `false`; not sent unless set. `false` makes Grok run one server-side tool call per turn; `api.x.ai` and relays that pass it through echo `false` and X search drops to one call per turn, so `max_turns` becomes a hard cap (2026-09-08: grok-4.5 via a relay went from 7–14 calls to 3 at a third of the cost; grok-4.6, direct or via the same relay, runs 3–4 calls on its own and gained nothing, so add it when `responses_tool_calls.total` is above 6). Relays that ignore it echo `true`. `max_tool_calls` is ignored by xAI and by relays, so it is not wired. CLI: `--responses-parallel-tool-calls false`. |
| `GROK_RESPONSES_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | `responsesAllowedDomains` | No | Responses | Comma-separated domain allow-list, max 5; mutually exclusive with excluded domains. |
| `GROK_RESPONSES_EXCLUDED_DOMAINS` | `responsesExcludedDomains` | No | Responses | Comma-separated domain deny-list, max 5; mutually exclusive with allowed domains. |
| `GROK_SEARCH_SOURCE` | `searchSource` | No | Responses | Default search source: `web`, `x`, or `both`. Default: `web`. |
| `GROK_RESPONSES_ALLOWED_X_HANDLES` | `responsesAllowedXHandles` | No | Responses | X handle allow-list, max 20; mutually exclusive with excluded handles. |
| `GROK_RESPONSES_EXCLUDED_X_HANDLES` | `responsesExcludedXHandles` | No | Responses | X handle deny-list, max 20; mutually exclusive with allowed handles. |
| `GROK_X_IMAGE_UNDERSTANDING` | `xImageUnderstanding` | No | Responses | Analyze images inside X posts; billed as extra tokens. Default: `false`. |
| `GROK_X_VIDEO_UNDERSTANDING` | `xVideoUnderstanding` | No | Responses | Analyze videos inside X posts; billed as extra tokens. Default: `false`. |
| `GROK_RESPONSES_OPENROUTER_ENGINE` | `responsesOpenRouterEngine` | No | OpenRouter Responses | `auto`, `native`, `exa`, `firecrawl`, `parallel`, or `perplexity`. Default: `auto`. |
| `GROK_DEFAULT_EXTRA` | `defaultExtra` | No | `search.js` | Combined Tavily/Firecrawl source target. Default: `6`. |
| `GROK_SOURCE_CHARS` | `sourceChars` | No | `search.js` | Per-source stdout snippet limit. Default: `400`; `0` omits snippets. |
| `GROK_MAX_SOURCES` | `maxSources` | No | `search.js` | Cap on source cards returned on stdout. Default: `12`; the untruncated list is stored at `sources.raw_path`. |
| `GROK_DEADLINE_SECONDS` | `deadlineSeconds` | No | all scripts | Whole-command deadline in seconds. Default: `240`, `0` disables; on expiry the command prints a `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` JSON envelope before exiting. |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | `tavilyApiKey` | No | `search.js`, `fetch.js`, `map.js` | Enables Tavily Search/Extract/Map. Without it, search/fetch still use Firecrawl Keyless and map uses Direct Map. |
| `TAVILY_API_KEYS` | `tavilyApiKeys` | No | Tavily paths | Comma-separated official key pool. Rotates only on quota or auth failure; cursor at `~/.cache/grok-search/tavily-rr.json`. Env wins over the config file. |
| `TAVILY_API_URL` | `tavilyApiUrl` | No | Tavily paths | Official base. Defaults to `https://api.tavily.com`. Do not point this at a third-party proxy. |
| `TAVILY_PROXY_URL` | `tavilyProxyUrl` | No | Tavily paths | Third-party compatible base, without a trailing slash. Keep it separate from official keys. |
| `TAVILY_PROXY_KEY` | `tavilyProxyKey` | No | Tavily paths | Proxy bearer token. When both URL and key are set, the proxy is tried first. |
| `TAVILY_PROXY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `tavilyProxyTimeoutMs` | No | Tavily paths | Proxy fail-fast timeout. Default `12000`, no retry. Empty search/map results also fall back; empty extract content does not. |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | `firecrawlApiKey` | No | `search.js`, `fetch.js` | Optional. Uses Firecrawl Keyless when absent; a key provides account-scoped credits and higher rate limits. |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_URL` | `firecrawlApiUrl` | No | Firecrawl paths | Defaults to `https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2`. |
| `GROK_OUTPUT_DIR` | `outputDir` | No | all scripts | Overrides long-output and run-record storage. Default: `~/.cache/grok-search/outputs/`. |
| `GROK_STATE_DIR` | `stateDir` | No | all scripts | Cross-command state directory (Firecrawl quota cooldown file `firecrawl-cooldown.json`). Default: `~/.cache/grok-search/`. |
| `GROK_RUN_LOG` | `runLog` | No | all scripts | Default `true`: every command writes one run-record JSON. `off` / `false` disables it, and `sources.raw_path` / `diagnostics.run_path` become null. |
| `GROK_DEBUG_RAW` | — | No | `search.js` | Env only. `1` embeds the redacted full Grok response as `grok_raw` in the run record (`--full-sources` does the same). |
| `GROK_DEBUG` | — | No | all scripts | Env only. `true` prints retry/cleanup/proxy debug logs to stderr. |
| `GROK_PROXY` | — | No | all scripts | Env only. Explicit proxy URL for this tool, or `off`/`direct` to disable proxy use. |

OpenRouter uses the `openrouter:web_search` server tool and does not append `:online` to model names.

## Output Schema

This version uses command-native JSON output. This is a **breaking change** from the older `ok`/`kind` style envelope.

On failure, every script returns:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "...",
    "code": "FETCH_ERROR"
  },
  "diagnostics": {
    "warnings": [],
    "provider_attempts": []
  }
}
```

On success, provider attempts, warnings, timestamps, and command options live under `diagnostics`.

## Search

```bash
./scripts/search.js "What changed in the latest Node.js LTS?"
./scripts/search.js --instructions "Quote the official changelog with dates; say so if not found" "node lts changelog"
./scripts/search.js --platform GitHub "pi coding agent search skill"
./scripts/search.js --responses-allowed-domains github.com "pi coding agent search skill"
./scripts/search.js --extra 10 "latest pi coding agent docs"
./scripts/search.js --no-extra "query"
./scripts/search.js --source-chars 200 "query"
./scripts/search.js --max-sources 8 "query"
./scripts/search.js --deadline 120 "query"
./scripts/search.js --full-sources "debug provider raw"
./scripts/search.js --responses-openrouter-engine exa "strict web-only query"
./scripts/search.js --source x --responses-parallel-tool-calls false "query"   # one tool call per turn, cheaper
```

`--instructions TEXT` separates "what to return" from "what to search". The query is the keyword string Tavily and Firecrawl search verbatim; the instructions are appended to the user message sent to Grok only (the system-prompt prefix is unchanged, so prompt caching is unaffected). With instructions present the query gets a `# Search query` header, otherwise a short query can be read as a stray line of the time context (Grok answered "no topic was specified" in a 2026-09-08 test). `diagnostics.options.instructions_chars` records the length and the run record stores the text; there is no config default.

`--responses-allowed-domains` / `--responses-excluded-domains` apply to all three channels: Grok `web_search` filters, Tavily `include_domains` / `exclude_domains`, and Firecrawl `includeDomains` / `excludeDomains`. Off-domain extras that still come back are kept but ranked after every Grok result; `diagnostics.options.extra_domain_filter` is `pushed`, `demoted`, or `none`, and extra provider attempts carry an `off_domain` count.

### Search sources

`--source` selects which Grok server-side tools are attached. The default is `web`:

```bash
./scripts/search.js --source x "what is X saying about grok-4.6"   # X only
./scripts/search.js --source both "reaction to the grok-4.6 release" # Grok routes
./scripts/search.js --source x --responses-allowed-x-handles xai,OpenAI "query"
./scripts/search.js --source x --x-from-date 2026-08-01 --x-to-date 2026-08-16 "query"
./scripts/search.js --source x --x-images "query"                  # analyze post images
```

- `x_search` supports handle allow/deny lists (mutually exclusive, max 20 each), `--x-from-date` / `--x-to-date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), and `--x-images` / `--x-videos` (off by default, billed as extra tokens; `--no-x-images` / `--no-x-videos` turn off what the config enabled).
- A **command-line** X filter promotes an unspecified `--source` to `both`; combining one with an explicit `--source web` raises `SEARCH_SOURCE_CONFLICT`. X filters in the config file only apply once X search is on — they never switch it on by themselves.
- `--responses-x-search` remains an alias for `--source both`.
- X search is billed at $5 per 1k calls, the same rate as web search. See `diagnostics.responses_x_search_calls` for the actual count.
- Tavily and Firecrawl extras only search the web, never X. On `--source x` they are off by default (`diagnostics.options.extra_mode` is `off-x-only` and a warning says so); `--extra N` turns them on, and `--source both` keeps them on.
- OpenRouter attaches `x_search` to native web search automatically, so `--source` is only a hint there; whatever is not enforced is reported in `diagnostics.warnings`.

X citations arrive as bare URLs whose `title` is only the inline citation marker, so source cards recover attribution from the URL:

```json
{
  "provider": "grok-responses",
  "source_type": "citation",
  "tool": "x_search",
  "url": "https://x.com/xai/status/2087942296721559607",
  "title": "@xai",
  "x_handle": "xai",
  "x_post_id": "2087942296721559607"
}
```

Post text and dates are not in the card; `answer.text` attributes each X claim by handle and date.

`search.js` is Responses-only. It calls `{GROK_API_URL}/responses` with `stream:false`, enables the provider-native web search tool, and returns:

- `answer.text`, `answer.chars`, `answer.original_chars`, `answer.truncated`, `answer.full_path`
- `sources.items`: one deduplicated, merged list of compact source cards, capped at `12` by default (`--max-sources`). Truncation order: `citation` > `opened: true` (pages Grok read via `open_page`) > in-domain extras > `searched` > off-domain extras. A URL seen on several channels becomes one card with `merged_from` listing the providers that contributed fields; placeholder titles such as `"1"` or `[2]` count as missing: a real title replaces them, otherwise `title` is omitted
- `sources.returned` / `sources.total` / `sources.omitted` so callers always know whether the list was truncated
- `sources.raw_path`: always set (unless `GROK_RUN_LOG=off`), pointing at the run record for this call: redacted argv, query, instructions, effective options, the full answer, the uncapped source lists, `grok_tool_calls`, and diagnostics. Errors and `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` write one too
- `sources.raw` only when `--full-sources` is used
- `diagnostics.responses_model`: the model the relay actually served; a warning is added when it differs from the requested one (on 2026-09-08 one relay answered every `grok-4.5` request with `grok-4.5-build`, at two to three times the tool calls and cost)
- `diagnostics.grok_endpoint`, `diagnostics.usage` / `diagnostics.cost_usd` when supplied by the provider, `diagnostics.responses_*` (`responses_tool_calls` is a `{ total, upstream: { web, x } | null, trace: { web, x }, by_action, failed? }` summary; the full list lives in `raw_path`), `diagnostics.search_budget` (the prompt's advisory budget next to the calls actually made, `enforced: false`), `diagnostics.warnings`, `diagnostics.provider_attempts`, `diagnostics.options`, `diagnostics.duration_ms`, and `diagnostics.searched_at`

By default the command starts Grok Responses, Tavily Search when configured, and Firecrawl Search in parallel. Tavily and Firecrawl remain independent evidence channels and are never injected into Grok input.

`--extra N` is the combined Tavily/Firecrawl target, defaulting to `6`. Both providers split the target evenly, with odd counts favoring Tavily. Without a Tavily key, Firecrawl Keyless receives the full target. `--no-extra` strictly disables both external search channels.

When Grok explicitly reports exhausted quota (402, a quota error code, or a 429 whose body mentions quota / credits / billing) and extra sources are available, the command returns a degraded success with `diagnostics.degraded: true` and `grok_error.code: QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`. A plain 429 degrades the same way with `RATE_LIMITED`. The visible answer states that it contains raw Tavily/Firecrawl results, while `diagnostics.grok_error` preserves the redacted upstream error. Authentication, protocol, and generic service failures do not trigger this fallback.

Firecrawl Keyless includes 1,000 credits per month and additional undisclosed daily IP limits. A free API key keeps the same monthly credits but provides higher rate limits, account-scoped usage, and access to more endpoints.

When the quota is exhausted Firecrawl answers 429 with `reason: credits` and a `retry_after_seconds` that is usually hours. The scripts stop retrying and write `{ until, auth_mode, reason, hit_at }` to `<stateDir>/firecrawl-cooldown.json`. During the cooldown, `search.js` and `fetch.js --provider auto` skip Firecrawl (the provider attempt reads `skipped: true` with `cooldown until <ISO>`); search gives the slots to Tavily, or leaves extras empty with a warning when Tavily is not configured. An explicit `--provider firecrawl` still makes the request and clears the cooldown on success. Cooldowns are scoped by `auth_mode`, so adding an API key takes effect immediately.

General retry rule: 408 / 429 / 5xx retry up to 3 times. A `Retry-After` (header or Firecrawl's `retry_after_seconds`) within the retry budget is honored as-is; one beyond the budget stops retrying instead of being clamped. Bad JSON, `success:false` bodies, 4xx such as 403, and scrape timeouts are requested once. Provider attempts carry `requests` (HTTP calls made) and `duration_ms`.

Source cards intentionally do not include long `description` or `content` fields. They use short `snippet` fields, with full raw data available through `sources.raw_path`.

## Fetch

```bash
./scripts/fetch.js https://example.com
./scripts/fetch.js --provider direct https://example.com
```

Default fetch output is a 12,000-character preview. Use `--max-chars 50000` only for an explicit deep read after the preview is useful.

```bash
./scripts/fetch.js --max-chars 50000 https://example.com
```

Provider order for `--provider auto`:

```text
Tavily Extract -> Firecrawl Scrape -> Direct Fetch
```

Direct Fetch is a best-effort fallback for normal HTTP(S) text pages. It strips simple HTML, formats JSON when possible, records redirects, and rejects binary/attachment/oversized responses.

Firecrawl Scrape uses Keyless without a key and automatically sends a Bearer token when `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is configured. The active mode is exposed as `diagnostics.firecrawl_auth_mode`.

X posts (`x.com/<handle>/status/<id>`) under `--provider auto` try Direct first regardless of keys, and count as success only when the page names the handle, carries a date, and has non-boilerplate text (main post only). If validation fails the normal Tavily → Firecrawl order runs; if that is unavailable too, the Direct text is returned with a warning. The 2026-09-08 side-by-side is the reason: Tavily is fast and free but returned one of three posts without a date and timed out on another; Firecrawl costs about 30 credits and 10+ seconds per post in exchange for ISO timestamps, engagement counts and the thread. Use `--provider firecrawl` explicitly when you need the thread. Any fetch with `credits_used >= 10` adds a cost warning to `diagnostics.warnings`.

X redirects `/<anyhandle>/status/<id>` to the real handle; validation uses the redirected URL.

Successful fetch output uses `content.text`, `content.chars`, `content.original_chars`, `content.truncated`, and `content.full_path`. `metadata` is normalized to `{ title, description, author, published_at, language, status, source_url }` from Firecrawl plus Direct's `status / content_type / content_length / content_disposition`. Provider details live under `diagnostics`, and the run record path under `diagnostics.run_path`.

## Map

```bash
./scripts/map.js https://docs.example.com --limit 20
./scripts/map.js --provider direct https://docs.example.com
./scripts/map.js https://docs.example.com --instructions "only API reference pages" --max-depth 2
```

Provider order for `--provider auto`:

```text
Tavily Map -> Direct Map
```

Without `TAVILY_API_KEY`, Tavily Map is unavailable and `map.js` falls back to Direct Map. Direct Map only checks same-site `/sitemap.xml`, then same-domain links on the homepage. It ignores `--instructions` and supports only `--max-depth 1`.

`--timeout` (default 150s) is the crawl budget handed to Tavily Map; Direct Map's own requests for the sitemap and home page use a separate `--direct-timeout` (default 30s), so one stalled request cannot consume most of the command deadline. Both values are recorded in `diagnostics.options`.

Successful map output uses `urls` for discovered URLs. Provider, response time, ignored instructions, warnings, attempts, and options live under `diagnostics`, with the run record path under `diagnostics.run_path`.

## Output Files

All scripts keep stdout as complete JSON. Long text fields are returned as previews, and the full content is written to:

```text
~/.cache/grok-search/outputs/
```

Set `GROK_OUTPUT_DIR` to override this path. Each run performs best-effort cleanup of `grok-search-*` files older than 30 days inside the output directory.

Besides overflow files, every command writes one run record `grok-search-<ts>-run-<kind>-<label>-<rand>.json` (`schema_version: 2`, mode 0600) on success, error, and `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`; `GROK_RUN_LOG=off` or `runLog: false` disables it. Search records hold redacted argv, query, instructions, effective options, the full answer, uncapped sources, `grok_tool_calls`, and diagnostics; fetch records hold the full content, metadata, and provider attempts; map records hold urls. `GROK_DEBUG_RAW=1` or `--full-sources` adds `grok_raw`.

Read these paths only when the preview is not enough:

- `answer.full_path` for full search answers
- `content.full_path` for full fetched page text
- `sources.raw_path` for the search run record (full source lists / provider raw)
- `diagnostics.run_path` for the fetch / map run record

## Smoke Tests

No key required:

./scripts/fetch.js --provider direct https://example.com
./scripts/map.js --provider direct https://example.com --limit 5
node tests/sources.test.js
node tests/proxy.test.js
node tests/responses.test.js

node tests/retry.test.js
node tests/firecrawl.test.js

Search requires Grok configuration:

```bash
export GROK_API_URL="https://your-openai-compatible-endpoint/v1"
export GROK_API_KEY="your-key"
./scripts/search.js "What changed in the latest Node.js LTS?"
```

## Common Errors

- `GROK_API_URL 未配置`: set `GROK_API_URL` before using `search.js`.
- `GROK_API_KEY 未配置`: set `GROK_API_KEY` before using `search.js`.
- `GROK_QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`: Grok quota is exhausted and extras are disabled, or neither Tavily nor Firecrawl produced a usable fallback result.
- `GROK_RATE_LIMITED`: Grok returned a plain 429 (no quota signal) and no fallback result was available.
- A provider attempt with `skipped: true` and `cooldown until …`: Firecrawl is in its post-quota cooldown. Delete `<stateDir>/firecrawl-cooldown.json` or pass `--provider firecrawl` explicitly to force a retry.
- `TAVILY_API_KEY 未配置`: explicit `--provider tavily` was requested without a Tavily key.
- Direct Fetch returns binary/attachment errors: the URL is not a text page or is too large for the direct fallback.
- Direct Map returns few or zero URLs: the site may rely on JavaScript, hide links, or have no public sitemap.

## Scope
